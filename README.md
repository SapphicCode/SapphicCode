Hi, I'm Cassandra. I've made the occasional name for myself.

Generally speaking, I like doing infrastructure as code, as well as setting up the occasional container orchestration cluster. I *especially* like automating repetitive tasks away.

## I like writing code in, and working with tools such as

- Python
- Go
- Lua
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io)
- [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html)
- [Vault](https://vaultproject.io)
- [Nomad](https://nomadproject.io)
- Kubernetes

### If given no choice

- Shell (`#!/bin/sh`)
- JavaScript / Node.js
- HTML
- Java

### If held at gunpoint

- C++
- C
- Assembly

## You may know me from

- The Discord API / bot scene, 2016-2018
- Way too many sideprojects I've put my name on
- "That girl who does way too much shit with Hashicorp Vault."
