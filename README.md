Hi, I'm Cassandra. I've made the occasional name for myself.

Generally speaking, I like doing infrastructure as code, as well as setting up the occasional container orchestration cluster. I *especially* like automating repetitive tasks away.

## I like writing code in

- Python
- Go
- Lua
- HCL2
  - Terraform
  - Nomad
- Shell (`#!/bin/sh`)
- YAML
  - Ansible
  - Concourse CI pipelines
  - Kubernetes

### If given no choice

- JavaScript
- HTML
- Java

### If held at gunpoint

- C
- C++
- Assembly

## You may know me from

- The Discord API / bot scene, 2016-2018
- Way too many sideprojects I've put my name on
- "That girl who does way too much shit with Hashicorp Vault."
